Download the zip then extract and I would pin the exe to your taskbar. Windows will prob block it from running 1st time as it's an unknown exe but is safe to run can take a look at the source code from the link as well. I'm thinking of having automatic updates but currently not implemented so any new updates would require u to download the new exe and replace it in the folder which is what updates are doing just downloading new files and replacing old files.
